# Pneumonia-Classification
Created a model to classify pneumonia from chest X-
ray images leveraging advanced techniques in deep
learning.
•
Developed a deep learning pipeline for pneumonia
classification using chest X-ray images, leveraging
VGG16 architecture.
•
Preprocessed medical imaging data using OpenCV
to enhance image quality through techniques like
resizing and noise reduction.
•
Fine-tuned the VGG16 model for pneumonia
dataset application.
•
Implemented data augmentation techniques to
improve model generalization.
•
Utilized TensorFlow/Keras for model development.
